# apps/api

VideoQ's Web API, built with Hono / TypeScript and running on Cloudflare Workers.

New contributors should start with [development environment setup](../../docs/getting-started/local-setup.md).
For API changes, start with the [API development guide](../../docs/guides/api.md).
The following reference covers details specific to the API package.

## Structure

The router in `packages/trpc` is the source of truth for the regular JSON API.
The API workspace implements request context and service adapters.

```

Dependencies flow from `tRPC router → Hono handler → service → repository`.
Input validation and procedure names are centralized in `packages/trpc/src/routers`.

## API contract

- Endpoint: `/api/trpc`
- Lists: `{ data: T[], meta: { total, limit, offset } }`
- Error data: tRPC code, HTTP status, `applicationCode?`, `details?`
- Dates and times: UTC ISO-8601

Hono's raw routes are limited to Better Auth / OAuth discovery, the Stripe webhook,
MCP, health checks, media binaries, multipart uploads, chat SSE, and CSV exports.

The canonical tRPC router lives in [`packages/trpc`](../../packages/trpc/).
Hono connects existing services to the procedure context. A REST/OpenAPI JSON API
and API reference UI are not provided.

## Authentication

Better Auth (`/api/auth/*`) is the source of truth.

### Browser sessions

- Cookie sessions through Better Auth. The SPA uses `credentials: "include"` + `better-auth/react`
- Email verification, password resets, and email changes use Better Auth verification flows
- Secret: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` / public URL: `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- Google sign-in (optional): `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  Redirect URI: `{BETTER_AUTH_URL}/api/auth/callback/google`

### API keys / OAuth

- API keys: `@better-auth/api-key` (prefix `vq_`; access level stored in metadata)
- MCP / third parties: `@better-auth/oauth-provider`
  (unauthenticated DCR is allowed for MCP; registration is rate-limited, and confidential client secrets expire after 30 days)
- Better Auth 1.7's protected resource is fixed at `/api/mcp`. When migrating to 1.7,
  revoke legacy DCR clients and tokens and register again. Access tokens last 15 minutes;
  both Bearer and DPoP are validated
- tRPC and browser-facing raw routes use cookie sessions; MCP uses API keys / OAuth Bearer tokens
- MCP OAuth validates `videoq.read` / `videoq.write`; API keys without metadata default to read-only
- MCP creation operations use `mcp_idempotency_records` for 30-day idempotency, with per-tool output schemas, safety annotations, and per-user rate limits
- The SPA determines sign-in status with Better Auth's `useSession`; profiles come from `account.me`
- User IDs are Better Auth's standard text UUIDs (existing rows were remapped to UUIDs by `0006_user_id_uuid`, invalidating sessions / OAuth tokens)
  - Schema changes use `drizzle-kit generate` (`meta/0005_snapshot.json` → `0006_snapshot.json`)
  - Data remapping is a historical Drizzle custom migration. It has already been applied; do not regenerate or edit it

## Secret encryption

User-specific external API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM.

- Key: `USER_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 bytes, base64url-encoded)
- Envelope: `v1.<nonce>.<ciphertext+tag>`
- Nonce: 12 bytes generated for each encryption operation

Manage `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, the OpenAI key, and S3/SQS credentials through
`wrangler secret` or a local `.dev.vars` file.

## Q&A agent

Q&A uses ReAct with the following tools, scoped to the current course after access
has been verified:

- `get_course_info`: Retrieves the course name, registered description, and total video count, plus each video's ID, title, description, position, and processing state. Up to 20 videos per page and 5 calls per answer. Course descriptions are limited to 2,000 characters and video descriptions to 500, with truncation indicated. Fetch subsequent videos using `videos_meta.next_offset`.
- `search_scenes`: Semantic search over transcripts. Optional `video_ids` narrow the search to specific videos in the course. Omitting them searches the entire course; IDs outside the course or an empty selection are invalid. Up to 3 calls per answer.

Course names, video counts, and similar questions can be answered from metadata
alone, without a vector search connection or embedding API calls. Explanations of
lesson content search transcripts and cite sources with `[N]`. Metadata is also
saved in `retrieved_contexts` as material retrieved for the answer, but is not given
scene citation numbers or timestamps.

Definitions, comparisons, examples, calculations, summaries, and "What can I learn?"
are treated as content questions and instructed to use search. The same applies
to questions consisting only of a term. Course-wide searches can omit `video_ids`
without first calling `get_course_info`. "Show me the registered description" is a
metadata request, while "Summarize the course content" searches transcripts whether
or not a description exists.

A video's `position` is its one-based display position; `order` is its stored sort
value. These are distinct from lecture numbers such as "Lecture 7" in a title.
The model can use tools for up to 8 turns, after which tools are removed and a final
answer is generated. Both streaming and non-streaming paths are supported.

Verification: `test/rag-agent.test.ts`, `test/chat-send.test.ts`, and
`test/workers/rag-agent.test.ts`. To verify pagination, permissions, and video
filtering against real PostgreSQL, set `QUOTA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` and run
`test/rag-course-info.integration.test.ts`.

The optional test below verifies tool selection with a real model. It reads
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `LLM_MODEL` from environment variables or
`apps/api/.dev.vars` and incurs LLM API charges. Database and search results use
fixed fixtures. It covers descriptions present/absent, metadata-only, content, and
mixed questions, Japanese/English, and streaming/non-streaming responses. It does
not run in regular CI.

```bash
RAG_SELECTION_LIVE=1 npm run test:unit --workspace @videoq/api -- test/rag-agent-selection.live.test.ts
```

## Database

Drizzle's modern schema is the only runtime model.

Main table groups:

- Auth (Better Auth): `users` (text UUID PK), `session`, `account`, `verification`, `apikey`, `jwks`, `oauth_*`
- Video: `videos`, `video_courses`, `video_course_members`, `tags`, `video_tags`
- Chat: `chat_logs`. `chat_log_evaluations` and `course_evaluation_snapshots` retain data from before evaluation was removed; no new evaluations are performed.
- Vector: `scene_embeddings` (both the worker and Hono use PGVectorStore; Hono searches are scoped to the owner and videos in the course)

Admin procedures: `admin.listUsers`, `admin.patch*`, and `admin.reindexAll`.
They are used by the frontend's `/admin` page.

Create the first administrator by promoting an existing account, using either its
username or email address:

```bash
npm run user:admin -- alice
```

There are two roles: regular user (`role = user`) and administrator (`role = admin`).
Existing administrators can toggle other users' administrator status in `/admin`.
They cannot remove their own administrator privileges or suspend their own account.

`0028_remove_legacy_user_roles` drops only the obsolete `is_staff` / `is_superuser`
columns, preserving existing `role` values. The API administrator flag was renamed
to `is_admin`, so update the API and Web in the same release and apply this database
migration after the old API has stopped. CD defers column removal with
`MIGRATION_PHASE=before-deploy`, then completes it in the `db-finalize` job after the
API and Web deploy successfully. For manual deployment, run the same preparation
phase first, switch to the new API, then run `MIGRATION_PHASE=all npm run db:migrate`.
Finish this release's column removal before adding subsequent migrations.

If the promotion command matches multiple accounts, it exits without changes.
Use `npm run user:admin -- --id <user-id>` to identify a single account.

If you hit sign-in/sign-up rate limits locally, clear the RateLimiter DO state and
restart the API:

```bash
npm run rate-limit:reset
```

```bash
npm run db:generate -- --name describe_the_schema_change
npm run db:check
npm run db:verify
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:studio
```

`src/db/schema/` is the schema's source of truth. Always create DDL migrations with
`drizzle-kit generate` (`db:generate` above). Do not manually edit generated SQL,
snapshots, or the journal. Only operations that Drizzle Kit cannot express as DDL,
such as data backfills, should use a Drizzle-managed custom migration created with
`npm run db:generate:custom -- --name describe_the_data_change`, starting with
`-- drizzle-kit:custom`. Do not put DDL in custom migrations or use `drizzle-kit push`
in shared or production environments. `db:verify` checks one-to-one correspondence
with the journal, exact agreement between generated DDL and snapshot differences,
and the absence of DDL in custom migrations.

Migration `0023` removes existing tables as part of retiring the learning features.
For existing environments, stop traffic and jobs before setting
`STUDY_REMOVAL_MAINTENANCE=true` and migrating. Without it, `db:migrate` stops before
making changes. See the [deployment procedure](../../docs/design/deployment-diagram.md#deploying-the-learning-feature-removal).

## Asynchronous jobs

SQS messages use native JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "transcribe_video",
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "payload": { "video_id": 123 }
}
```

The consumer is [`apps/worker/`](../worker/). Local development uses ElasticMQ;
production uses Amazon SQS.

Job submissions are stored in the `external_tasks` outbox in the same transaction
as business data updates and are usually delivered to SQS immediately. Alarms in
the `TASK_SCHEDULER` Durable Object schedule recovery for rows left after a process
stops just after database commit or after an SQS failure, as well as abandoned
uploads. The five-minute cron is no longer used. Daily maintenance also performs
recovery. Rows that fail 48 times are stopped by setting `dead_at` and reported in
structured logs.

At `17 3 * * *` (UTC), completed outbox and execution ledger records older than
30 days—longer than SQS's maximum retention period—are deleted in small batches.
Execution records still referenced by incomplete outbox entries are retained.

## Cloudflare bindings

The production Worker is deployed from `.github/workflows/cd.yml` using
`wrangler.jsonc`, with `apps/api` as Wrangler's working directory. Unlike Pages,
there is no repository root directory setting in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HYPERDRIVE` | Neon PostgreSQL |
| `VIDEO_BUCKET` | Videos, transcripts, and thumbnails |
| `RATE_LIMITER` | Distributed rate limiting |
| `TASK_SCHEDULER` | Scheduled recovery for undelivered jobs, abandoned uploads, etc. (Durable Object) |

See `wrangler.jsonc` and `.dev.vars.example` for R2's S3-compatible endpoint, SQS,
LLM/embedding settings, the OAuth issuer, and related configuration.
Production authentication and invitation emails require `MAILGUN_API_KEY`.
Cloudflare Email Sending and KV are not used. If email is not configured locally,
promote the account using the README instructions.

Commands to synchronize and inspect production resource settings:

```bash
npm run cf:hyperdrive:disable-cache
npm run cf:hyperdrive:show
npm run cf:r2-cors:apply
npm run cf:r2-cors:list
```

`r2-cors.production.json` is the source of truth for R2 CORS. For updates, use a
token that can manage only Hyperdrive and the target R2 bucket, separate from the
regular Worker deployment token.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run cf-typegen
```

To start the local dependencies together:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres garage garage-init elasticmq worker
```
